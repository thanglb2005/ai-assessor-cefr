## Shared gates and completion

- Sang (M03/M04 owner) must review `QCMeasurement`, the `QCResult` extension and 16 kHz output contract; M03 must review PASS-only dispatch. Record comments/approval before recommending PR merge; Thắng explicitly deferred this review until tasks are implemented.
- Each task gets its own prompt ID/file under the approved Phase 05 artifact and a fresh branch fingerprint. Prompt status records the actual executor and evidence; M02-PROMPT-001 was issued to Codex.
- Branch/PR order across tasks: SCRUM-46 → SCRUM-47 → SCRUM-48 → SCRUM-49. M02 order is SCRUM-46 → SCRUM-47. SCRUM-47 starts from the SCRUM-46 implementation commit; after SCRUM-46 merges, update SCRUM-47 against current `main` if the PR merge method requires it.
- No task may commit audio, transcript, model, secret or actual participant data. No production QC defaults are added.

**Trạng thái:** SCRUM-46 IMPLEMENTED / CHECKS PASS; SCRUM-47 PENDING. **Phase 05 verdict:** APPROVED by Thắng · 28/09/2026; Sang review PENDING.
